"""fix_truncated_datetime_values

A previous migration (b942e8c5d545) used batch_alter_table to change
timestamp columns from String to DateTime(timezone=True) on SQLite.
Alembic's batch mode uses CAST(col AS DATETIME) during the data copy,
and SQLite's DATETIME has NUMERIC affinity — so ISO strings like
"2026-03-17T14:37:11+00:00" were truncated to the integer 2026.

This migration converts those corrupted integer values back to a
placeholder datetime string so the application can read them again.
